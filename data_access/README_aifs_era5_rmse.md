# AIFS vs ERA5 RMSE Comparison Pipeline

**Author:** Yeganeh Khabbazian  
**Tool:** Used GitHub Copilot

---

## Overview

This project evaluates **AIFS Single forecasts** against **ERA5 reanalysis** by computing RMSE over a Central Europe region and producing spatial and temporal analyses.

**What the pipeline does (configurable):**

- **Downloads** AIFS forecasts and ERA5 reanalysis fields (if missing)
- **Pairs** AIFS valid times with matching ERA5 timestamps
- **Computes RMSE** per pair and aggregates by lead time, day, and hour
- **Generates plots** for spatial RMSE, time-series summaries, and land/sea comparisons

**Why RMSE?** RMSE is a standard forecast metric that squares errors before averaging, so it penalizes large errors and is sensitive to outliers. Therefore it highlights bad forecasts and spatial hotspots, which fits this project.

**Scope:**
- **Variables:** 2m air temperature (2t), 500 hPa temperature (t500)
- **Spatial focus:** Central Europe (cropped for maps and summary statistics)
- **Temporal focus:** AIFS valid times that overlap ERA5 coverage
- **Configurable downloads:** Change what gets downloaded in `aifs_config.yaml` and `era5_config.yaml`.

## Dataset Information

**AIFS**: AIFS is a machine learning–based global weather forecasting model operational since February 2025, developed by ECMWF to complement the traditional physics-based Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The current version was trained on ERA5 reanalysis data (1979–2018) and fine-tuned on operational IFS forecasts (2019–2020), using both pressure-level and surface variables along with auxiliary forcing information such as solar radiation.

**Operational specifications**: AIFS produces global forecasts at 0.25° × 0.25° resolution four times daily (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC), in 6-hourly forecast steps. Two operational configurations exist: AIFS Single (deterministic model, operational since 25 February 2025) and AIFS Ensemble (ensemble model, operational since 1 July 2025). 

| Property | Details |
|---|---|
| **Spatial resolution** | ~0.25° regular lat/lon grid |
| **Temporal resolution** | 6-hourly initialization (00/06/12/18 UTC) |
| **Lead times** | Multiple forecast steps |
| **Coverage** | Global |
| **Access** | ECMWF Open Data (free, limited retention) |
| **Format used here** | GRIB2 |


**ERA5** (ECMWF Reanalysis v5) is global climate reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. It blends observations (satellites, weather stations, aircraft) with model data via advanced data assimilation.

| Property | Details |
|---|---|
| **Spatial resolution** | ~0.25° regular lat/lon grid |
| **Temporal resolution** | Hourly (this project uses 6-hourly subset) |
| **Variables** | Many fields; this project uses temperature |
| **Coverage** | Global |
| **Access** | ECMWF ERA5 (downloaded locally for matching) |
| **Format used here** | NetCDF (.nc) |

## Köppen Climate Zones (Background Layer)

**What it is:** The Köppen–Geiger climate classification divides the world into climate zones based on long‑term temperature and precipitation. We use it as a background layer to contextualize RMSE patterns (e.g., coastal vs continental climates).

**Where to download:** Use the dataset page below (it provides a 1km GeoTIFF plus a legend file).  
Download the **GeoTIFF** and **legend.txt** from:  
```
https://data-staging.naturalcapitalproject.org/dataset/sts-b04939b0df93eb3f4305a065933c66122a0edc6fa425b157b99aa7b4b4446d20
```

**Where to put it:**  
Place the GeoTIFF in:
```
Earth_System/earth-system-data-processing/data/static/
```
Use this filename (the analysis script checks it):
- `koppen_geiger_climatezones_1991_2020_1km.tif`

**Class list (30 zones):**  
We follow the standard 30-class Köppen legend. A few examples:
- **Af** = Tropical rainforest  
- **Csa** = Hot-summer Mediterranean  
- **Dfb** = Warm-summer humid continental  
- **ET** = Alpine tundra  
- **EF** = Polar ice cap

Full list used in this project:
Af, Am, Aw, BWh, BWk, BSh, BSk, Csa, Csb, Csc, Cwa, Cwb, Cwc, Cfa, Cfb, Cfc, Dsa, Dsb, Dsc, Dsd, Dwa, Dwb, Dwc, Dwd, Dfa, Dfb, Dfc, Dfd, ET, EF.

## Land sea mask

This parameter is the proportion of land, as opposed to ocean or inland waters (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters), in a grid box.
This parameter has values ranging between zero and one and is dimensionless.
In cycles of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) from CY41R1 (introduced in May 2015) onwards, grid boxes where this parameter has a value above 0.5 can be comprised of a mixture of land and inland water but not ocean. Grid boxes with a value of 0.5 and below can only be comprised of a water surface. In the latter case, the lake cover is used to determine how much of the water surface is ocean or inland water.
In cycles of the IFS before CY41R1, grid boxes where this parameter has a value above 0.5 can only be comprised of land and those grid boxes with a value of 0.5 and below can only be comprised of ocean.

## Scope and Configuration

- **Region for maps:** Central Europe  
  - `EUROPE_EXTENT = (-5, 25, 43, 58)` (lon_min, lon_max, lat_min, lat_max)
- **Region for RMSE crop:**  
  - `EUROPE_BBOX = (56, 0, 44, 20)` (N, W, S, E)
- **Variables:** 2t and t500
- **Matching:** AIFS valid time must exist in ERA5
- **Global size cap:** `max_total_gb` in `aifs_config.yaml` or `era5_config.yaml` (applies to AIFS+ERA5 combined)

EUROPE_EXTENT is used for plotting, while EUROPE_BBOX is used for RMSE computation
to reduce I/O and processing cost.

## Pipeline Architecture

The analysis runs through five stages, each independent but typically orchestrated together:

```
Download Layer
    ↓
Indexing & Pairing Layer
    ↓
RMSE Computation Layer
    ↓
Aggregation Layer
    ↓
Plotting & Analysis Layer
```

### Stage 1: Download
- **Scripts:** `download_aifs_forecasts.py`, `download_era5_reanalysis.py`
- **What happens:** Fetches AIFS GRIB2 files and ERA5 NetCDF files, stores in dated directories
- **Output:** Raw files in `data/aifs/raw/` and `data/era5/downloads/real/`

### Stage 2: Indexing & Pairing
- **Script:** `compute_aifs_era5_rmse.py` 
- **What happens:** Scans downloaded files, creates manifest of available pairs, validates time alignment
- **Called by:** `compute_rmse_outputs.py` during orchestration
- **Output:** Pair manifests with status (`ok`, `missing_aifs`, `missing_era5`) saved to CSV

### Stage 3: RMSE Computation
- **Script:** `compute_rmse_outputs.py` 
- **What happens:** Loops over valid pairs, opens each AIFS+ERA5 file pair, computes squared error grids
- **Bottleneck:** ~70% of total time (1–2 sec per pair due to file I/O)
- **Output:** Squared-error grids (intermediate, stored in memory)

### Stage 4: Aggregation
- **Script:** `aggregate_rmse_outputs.py`
- **What happens:** Groups squared-error grids by lead time, date, and hour; computes RMSE; saves NetCDF + CSV summaries
- **Output:** `data/rmse_outputs/rmse_by_step_*.nc`, `rmse_by_day_*.nc`, `rmse_by_hour_*.nc` (and CSV )

### Stage 5: Plotting & Analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook:** `analyze_rmse_outputs.ipynb` (full orchestration + plotting, interactive)
- **What happens:** Generates scatter maps, time series, and land/sea comparisons; saves to `data_access/results/`
- **Calls:** Stages 1–4 in sequence
- **Output:** PNG plots in `results/` directory

## Grid Alignment (AIFS vs ERA5)

We validate the grids using:  
`data_access/scripts/verify/check_aifs_era5_grid.py`

**Observed results:**
- **Shape:** both are **721 × 1440**
- **Latitude:** 90 → −90 with **0.25°** spacing (descending)
- **Longitude:** matches **after roll/normalization** to 0 → 359.75 (0.25° spacing)
- **Grid type:** regular lat/lon for both

**Interpretation:**  
AIFS uses the same longitude values as ERA5 but starts at −180 (wrapped ordering).  
After we **roll** AIFS longitudes (as implemented in `compute_aifs_era5_rmse.py`), the grids match exactly.  
So the fix is **re-ordering**, not interpolation.

After rolling AIFS longitudes from [-180, 180) to [0, 360), the grids match exactly.

## Data Access Constraints

**ECMWF Open Data (AIFS):**
- Free access, no authentication
- Retains only a few recent forecast days

**ECMWF MARS Archive (historical):**
- Full archive, but requires institutional access or license

This project uses Open Data to stay within the retention window.

## Scaling Behavior and Performance

### Current Limitations

1. **Open Data retention window** — ECMWF only keeps the last ~4 days. Requires daily automated runs to maintain continuous coverage.
3. **Repeated file I/O** — each pair independently opens AIFS GRIB and ERA5 NetCDF files (no caching between pairs except while plotting).
4. **Memory-intensive aggregation** — all squared-error grids are loaded into RAM before aggregating; this limits multi-month runs on constrained systems.
5. **Storage growth** — full-resolution RMSE maps (721×1440 grids) add up quickly


**Where the time goes:**
1. **RMSE computation** (~70%): `compute_pair_rmse()` in `compute_aifs_era5_rmse.py` is called once per pair during the pre-computation phase. Each call opens a GRIB file and an ERA5 NetCDF, aligns coordinates, crops, and subtracts per pair. This is done once offline and results are cached to NetCDF.
2. **Aggregation & plotting** (~25%): stacking grids and rendering scatter maps.
3. **Downloads & indexing** (~5%): fast unless network is slow.

**Notebook execution** is now fast because it loads pre-computed RMSE from NetCDF files instead of recomputing per pair. See "Completed Optimizations" below. 

### Main Bottleneck: Per-Pair File I/O (During Computation)

Each pair is processed in a loop to compute RMSE:

**Impact:** 
- 100 pairs → 200 file opens (100 AIFS + 100 ERA5)
- 1000 pairs → 2000 file opens

This is unavoidable for the initial computation, but the results are cached so recomputation is never needed.


### Tertiary Bottleneck: Plotting Dense Maps

Scatter maps with 1+ million points are slow to render. I mitigated it in 
rmse_coarsen_factor: 4,  # Coarsen 0.25° grid to 1°, reducing points to ~65k


This is effective and keeps plotting time relatively short.

### Network Rate Limiting 

ECMWF Open Data has a soft cap of ~500 simultaneous connections. During busy hours, requests may fail with **HTTP 429** (too many requests).

**Current behavior:** Failed requests are retried with linear backoff (default: 10s, 20s, 30s, etc. for up to 5 retries). For HTTP 429, you may need to manually wait or increase the `--sleep` parameter to a larger base value (e.g., 30–60 seconds).


---

## Possible Improvements

These optimizations would help for multi-month runs or parallel deployments. Not implemented because the current 1–2 week analysis window doesn't justify the added complexity.

### High-Impact Optimizations

1. **Parallelize pair processing** (Est. **3–6× speedup**)
   - Currently: sequential loop over pairs
   - Proposed: 4–8 workers
 


5. **Resume logic** (Est. **huge speedup on re-runs**)
   - Currently: recompute all pairs every run
   - Proposed: save pair results to a manifest, skip already-computed pairs
   - Why not done: the script is modified constantly and need fresh computations for now

6. **Compressed outputs** (Est. **20–30% storage savings, negligible runtime impact**)
   - Currently: NetCDF with default compression
   - Proposed: NetCDF with `zlib` or Zarr format
   



## Robustness Across the Pipeline

The pipeline includes multiple safeguards to prevent data loss, corruption, and runaway resource consumption.

### Download Layer (`download_aifs_forecasts.py` & `download_era5_reanalysis.py`)

**Network Resilience:**
- **Retries with exponential backoff** — transient network failures are retried automatically; permanent errors (404s) are not retried, saving time on missing data
- **HTTP 429 backoff** — respects ECMWF rate limiting; backs off gracefully when the portal is busy

**Disk & Storage Guards:**
- **Free disk space check** — stops downloads if available space drops below `min_free_gb` threshold, preventing "disk full" crashes mid-run
- **Global size cap** — `STOP_DOWNLOADS_<limit>GB` marker file created when combined AIFS+ERA5 exceeds `max_total_gb` config; prevents scheduler from accidentally filling all storage
  - *Why this matters:* scheduler runs daily; if one forgets to monitor, data could grow unbounded. This automatically stops it.
  - *Set in config:* `max_total_gb: 1.0` (default) or adjust.

**Download Integrity:**
- **Idempotent downloads** — skips files that already exist unless `--overwrite` flag is used; safe to re-run without wasting bandwidth
- **File size validation** — flags suspiciously small/large files (e.g., if download was truncated)
- **Completeness checks** (ERA5) — verifies all expected days are present before marking download complete; doesn't proceed with partial days

**Operational Visibility:**
- **Manifest + structured logs** — every download attempt (success/failure) recorded in CSV manifest and dated log files; essential for debugging failed runs
  - AIFS manifest: `data/aifs/raw/manifest.csv`
  - ERA5 manifest: `data/era5/downloads/{real|mock}/manifest.csv`
  - Logs: `data_access/logs/aifs_log/`, `data_access/logs/era5_log/`

**AIFS-Specific:**
- **Partial-day protection** — "today's" longest lead-time forecasts are skipped to avoid downloading data that will become stale before the next run

**ERA5-Specific:**
- **Mock vs. real separation** — test downloads go to `downloads/mock/`, production to `downloads/real/`; prevents test files from contaminating real archive
- **Archiving** — downloaded files organized by date in `archive/real/`; enables fast re-pairing without re-downloading

### Computation Layer

**Key safeguards in indexing, pairing, and aggregation:**
- **Explicit pairing status** — each pair marked with status (`ok`, `missing_aifs`, `missing_era5`, `time_not_found`); audit trail for debugging
- **Time alignment checks** — verifies ERA5 contains valid time before computation
- **Skips failed pairs** — only aggregates pairs with `status='ok'`; prevents NaN propagation
- **Dimension validation** — checks spatial dimensions exist before stacking
- **Dual output format** — saves both NetCDF (detailed) and CSV (quick sanity checks)
- **Stale output cleanup** — removes old RMSE files before rerun to prevent mixing results
- **Per-figure exception handling** — one plot failing doesn't stop others
- **Eager dataset loading** — loads fully into memory to prevent file handle exhaustion

**Validation utilities:**
- **`check_aifs_era5_grid.py`** — validates grid alignment (shape, coords, lon wrapping)
- **`check_nans_aifs_era5.py`** — quick scan for data corruption across large datasets

### Automation Layer (`scripts/schedule/*`)

- **Daily scheduler** — runs downloads on macOS and Windows automatically; prevents data loss to short Open Data retention window (~4 days)
- **Conditional execution** — can disable specific steps (download, RMSE, plots) via config; prevents re-running expensive steps unnecessarily
- **Documented turnoff** — see `data_access/scripts/schedule/README_automation.md` for how to pause scheduler without breaking workflow
